# Plotly-Deploy
A repo to deploy a dashboard via my GitHub Page of my Biodiversity data visualization.

# About this project

Purpose: Build an interactive data visualization for the web.

In this project, I used Javascript's Plotly library to create three basic plots: horizontal bar chart, gauge chart, and bubble chart. I used D3.json to fetch external data and Javascript functional programming to manipulate the data. I added event handlers to add interactivity to this data visualization. Finally, I deployed this interactive chart via GitHub Pages.
